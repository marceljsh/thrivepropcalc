# Thrive Property Calculator


## `üöÄ How to use`

1. Run `make build` to compile the program. It will result in binary file `bin/thrivepropcalc`.
2. Prepare the inputs in `input.txt`
3. Run `make run` to run the binary file. You should provide an `input.txt`, otherwise the program won't run as intended.
4. Run `make clean` to clean up the compiled file.
5. Alternatively, you can build and run the program with a single command `make all`.


## `‚ùì How does it work?`

First, we need to understand the rules.

1. Base property value is calculated per square meter:
   - Standard location: Rp 10,000,000/m^2
   - Premium location: Rp 15,000,000/m^2

2. Annual value adjustments:
   - Land appreciates 5% annually
   - Residential buildings depreciate 2.5% annually
   - Commercial buildings depreciate 3.5% annually

3. Location bonuses:
   - Premium location adds 20% to total value
   - Corner lot adds 15% to total value

5. Monthly maintenance calculation:
   - Residential base fee: Rp 2,500/m¬≤
   - Commercial base fee: Rp 3,500/m¬≤
   - Security fee: Rp 1,000/m¬≤
   - Cleaning fee: Rp 800/m¬≤

These are the formulas that will be used to calculate the property value.

![Calculation Formulas](public/formulas.png)

- `V` is the property's value.
- `Appr_land` and `R_land` are the land appreciation factor and rate, respectively.
- `Depr_land` and `R_building` are the building depreciation factor and rate, respectively.
- `Rate_premium` and `Rate_corner` (it should be `R_premium` and `R_corner`, i made a mistake lmao) are the rates of premium bonus and corner bonus, respectively.
